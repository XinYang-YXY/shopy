# Shopy
My team built e-commerce for my brand called YXY.
I am the lead of the team, in charge of distributing the work and coordinating the project, etc.

I am also in charge of UI/UX Design
1) I designed the website, the navigation bar, footer, and home page, etc.
2) Built the design from scratch, using custom HTML, CSS, and JS, not templates are used.
3) Responsive design which is mobile-friendly, to provide good user experience to smartphone users,
thus capturing the smartphone users, boost our user base.

I am also in charge of Version Control/Integration
1) We used Github for the version and integration.
2) I created the master branch with the basic structure, then give a branch for each teammate to build their feature.
3) When the teammate finished and fully tested their features, I will merge their branch back to the master branch to finish the integration.

I am also in charge of Hosting
1) Website is xinyang-geek.site
2) The app is hosted on AWS, encrypted with HTTPS.
3) AWS allows our application to scale up in minutes when there is a surge user traffic, thus better
business efficiency.

I am also in charge of Database
1) We are using SQLite as our database.
2) I built the tables inside the database.
3) Using SQLite allows us to change to other relational databases such as PostgreSQL easily.


I am also in charge of User Management Feature
1) Validation applies to each field.
2) Specific error messages to guide users to solve their errors.
3) User able to make changes to their info, their email and profile pictures, etc.


I am also in charge of Order Management Feature
1) I make use of fetch API to send data from the JS to the Flask server. So the page is not refreshed when the user sends data to the Flask server. Thus better UX.
2) Users can add items into their cart, update the cart content, remove items from the cart and all cart information is stored inside the database.
